# 2048 Game
Overview
This project is a JavaScript implementation of the classic 2048 game, a popular sliding puzzle game originally created by Gabriele Cirulli. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is fully functional, featuring a dynamic UI, responsive controls, and game state management.

Features
4x4 Grid Gameplay: The game board consists of a 4x4 grid where tiles can be moved in four directionsâ€”left, right, up, and down.
Tile Merging: When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one, doubling the value.
Random Tile Generation: After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) appears on a random empty spot on the board.
Win Condition: The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 appears on the board.
Game Over Condition: The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the board is full.
Score Tracking: The score increases with each merge, reflecting the sum of the merged tiles.
Responsive Controls: The game can be played using the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Restart Functionality: Players can restart the game at any time, resetting the board and score.
UI Interaction: A dynamic interface with a start and restart button, win/lose messages, and real-time score updates.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: The core logic of the game is implemented in JavaScript, including game state management and user interactions.
HTML/CSS: The structure and design of the game board, tiles, and user interface elements are created using HTML and CSS.
